# AbacusLang

This stack based language took a huge inspiration from porth and forth. I had initially made the compiler in python, but decided to refactor it and use rust so that I could get more familiar with the language.

It has some basic arithmetic operations and some conditional statements are implemented. You may find some examples in the examples folder.

Keep in mind this project is not meant to be professional, it has simple solutions to complex problems that usually require more elaborate architectures.

## Getting Started

Clone the RustyWire repository:
```shell 
git clone https://github.com/Ruben1729/abacus-lang
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```shell
cd abacus-lang
```
Run the project using Cargo:
```shell
cargo run file_name.aba
```
Build and link the file:
```shell
./build.sh file_name.aba
```

## Future Plans
I'd like to implement other features such as functions, for loops, and eventually bootstrap the compiler.
